  ## Introduction

  The Enc-Dec Python Tkinter project presents a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using various encryption algorithms. It serves as a 
  powerful tool for secure communication and learning about encryption techniques through an interactive GUI.

  ## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Support for multiple encryption algorithms.
- Implementation of secure encryption and decryption methods.
- Real-time visualization of the encryption process.

  ## Getting Started

  ### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of GUI concepts.

  ## Usage

1. Launch the GUI application, which opens the interface for encryption and decryption.

  ### Encrypting a Message

1. Enter your name.
2. Input the message you wish to encrypt in the designated field.
3. Select an encryption key.
4. Click the "Encrypt" button.
5. The encrypted message will be displayed in the output area.

  ### Decrypting a Message

1. Input the encrypted message in the designated field.
2. Select the same key used for encryption.
3. Click the "Decrypt" button.
4. The decrypted message will be displayed in the output area.

  ## Supported Method

- Vigen√®re cipher
